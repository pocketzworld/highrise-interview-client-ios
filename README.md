# Highrise Interview Client (iOS)

This is a stub application for building a basic backend using the `highrise-interview-model` base for model objects with Flatbuffers. The application requires the latest Xcode which can be installed on the Mac App Store.

## Setup

1. Clone repository.
2. Pull in submodules with `git submodule update --init`.
